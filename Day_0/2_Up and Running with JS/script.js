# 2. Up and Running with JS

- Why most of time script codes placing at the bottom of the body?
    
    Simply because html elements need to render first.



    Modern JavaScript Loading/ s
    1- Default
    2- Async
    3- Defer




    Modules
    - export default sayHello();
    - import sayHello from "./Gloria.js";

    Note: If the script/ s declared as ‘module’ they are become ‘defer’ as default.
